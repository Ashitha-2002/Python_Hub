Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python was designed with code readability in mind, using indentation to define code blocks instead of brackets. 
This makes it an ideal language for beginners while still being powerful enough for experienced developers to build complex applications. 
Its syntax is clean and easy to understand, allowing programmers to focus more on solving problems than on writing complex code structures.
